👋 Hi, I'm Michal — a retired IT consultant with over 30 years of experience in programming, networking, and systems integration.

🛠 I specialize in scripting (Bash, Python), self-hosted infrastructure, Linux server automation, and custom dashboards.

💡 These days, I focus on open-source tools, Raspberry Pi projects, and sharing solutions that simplify everyday IT challenges.

🌐 You’ll often find me working with Docker, Jekyll, Fastfetch, Pi-hole, and building helpful utilities for personal and professional use.

📚 I believe in clean code, lifelong learning, and giving back to the tech community—one script at a time.
