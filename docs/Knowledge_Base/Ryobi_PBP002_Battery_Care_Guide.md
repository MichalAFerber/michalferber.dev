# Ryobi PBP002 Battery Care Guide

**For: 18 V ONE+ 1.5 Ah (PBP002)**  
**Applies to: Any Ryobi 18 V lithium pack, especially small-capacity ones used often**

## ⚙️ Should You Leave the Battery in the Tool?

{: .note-title }
> **Best practice**
> 
> Remove it when you’re done using the tool for the day._

### Why:

- 🔌 **Parasitic drain:**  
    Even when “off,” some tools (esp. with LEDs or smart triggers) can draw a tiny idle current over time. Leaving it attached can slowly discharge below safe voltage.
- 🌡️ **Heat transfer:**  
    If the tool is hot after use, the battery sitting inside it absorbs that heat → shortens lifespan.
- ⚡ **Safety & longevity:**  
    Prevents accidental activation or arcing in case of metal contact, and reduces physical strain on terminals.
- 🧰 **Exception:**  
    If you’re actively using the tool multiple times during the same day, it’s fine to leave the battery seated between sessions.

## 🗓️ **Weekly / Monthly Charging & Storage Plan (for 2–3 batteries)**

|Day / Period|Action|Why|
|---|---|---|
|**Daily Use (After Each Session)**|Let the pack cool (~15–30 min) before charging. Then charge to full and remove once ready.|Avoids charging hot packs and over-stressing cells.|
|**Next Morning / Before Use**|Check battery LEDs (press test). If low, top off charge before heavy use.|Keeps voltage balanced and ensures readiness.|
|**Mid-Week (e.g., Wednesday)**|Rotate battery order — use a different pack each day.|Evens out wear cycles.|
|**End of Week (Friday / Saturday)**|Clean terminals with a soft cloth, inspect for dirt or cracks.|Prevents oxidation and maintains strong electrical contact.|
|**Every 2 Weeks**|Check stored (idle) batteries; ensure mid-charge (40–60%). Recharge briefly if below.|Avoids long low-voltage stress.|
|**Monthly (1st of the Month)**|Do a “rotation charge”: use each pack for a short task and recharge fully once.|Keeps cell balancing even and prevents stale voltage.|
|**Every 6 Months**|Deep maintenance check: verify LED health, case integrity, contacts. Recharge all to ~50%.|Matches Ryobi’s official long-term storage recommendation.|
|**Yearly**|Label each battery with a small sticker (“2025-A”, “2025-B”, etc.) to track age and cycle count.|Helps you see performance drop-off trends over time.|

### 🔋 **RYOBI 18 V BATTERY CARE CHECKLIST**

**After Every Use**
-  Remove battery from tool
-  Let it cool before charging
-  Charge only with Ryobi charger
-  Remove from charger once full

**Weekly**
-  Rotate batteries in use
-  Clean contacts
-  Check charge level on stored packs

**Monthly**
-  “Refresh” charge cycle on all packs
-  Store unused ones at ~50 % charge
-  Keep away from heat, cold, or moisture

**Every 6 Months**
-  Recharge stored packs to ~50 %
-  Inspect for cracks, bulges, or loose contacts

**Storage Rules**
-  Store in a cool (50–77 °F) dry spot
-  Never store fully charged or empty
-  Do **not** leave in tool or charger long-term

## 🧠 **Pro Tips for Maximizing Lifespan**

- **Avoid “top-off mania.”**  
    Constantly topping up after just a few minutes of use isn’t harmful, but unnecessary — try to let it drop to 30–50 % before recharging.
- **Use all batteries evenly.**  
    Alternate between them; don’t always use the same pack for the same tool.
- **Label them (A/B/C).**  
    Makes tracking usage and rotation easier.
- **If power fades suddenly, stop using it.**  
    Don’t force it down to zero; swap out and recharge.
- **Never try to revive “dead” packs with DIY jump-start tricks.**  
    Ryobi’s charger has built-in recovery logic — forcing voltage manually is dangerous.
